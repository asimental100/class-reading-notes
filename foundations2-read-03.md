Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

Relative Viewport Lengths in CSS (most commonly expressed in percentages or em units.)
  1. vw = Viewports Width
  2. vh = Viewports Height
  3. vmin = Minimum of the viewport’s height and width
  4. vmax = Maximum of the viewport’s height and width

Float = a CSS positioning property with four valid values.
  1. left = floats left
  2. right = floats right
  3. none = the default that ensures no float
  4. inherit = assumes the float value of it's parent
  
  A. Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Clear has five valid values.
    a. 1. both = clears floats from left and right
    a. 2. left = clears floats left
    a. 3. right = clears floats right
    a. 4. none = clears the default that ensures no float
    a. 5. inherit = clears the float value of it's parent
