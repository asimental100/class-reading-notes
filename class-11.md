Search Engine Opitimization (SEO) = the practice of trying to help your site appear neared to the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
  1. At it's heart, SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.
  2. SEO is often split into two areas: On-Page Techniques and Off-Page Techniques
    2.a. On-Page Techniques are the methods that you can use on your webpages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking for keywords in 7 key places.
      2.a.1. Page title - appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser.
      2.a.2. URL/Web Address - the name of the file is part of the URL, where possible, use keywords in the file name.
      2.a.3. Headings - keywords in heading elements tell a search engine what a page is about and give it greater weight than other text.
      2.a.4. Text - Where possible it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2 - 3 times. Do not, however over-use these terms to ensure readability.
      2.a.5. Link Text - Using keywords in the text that creates links between pages.
      2.a.6. Image Alt Text - search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images with alt text, helps with image-based searches.
      2.a.7. Page Descriptions - inside the head element and using a meta tag you can write a description that will appear on search engines to describe the page.
      2.a.BONUS Do not try to fool search engines, they will detect obvious SEO manipulation and penalize you for it.
    2.b. Off-Page Techniques include getting other sites to link to your site because search engines determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other relevant sites that link to yours. To this: the words that appear in links to your site should also appear in the text of the page that the site links to.
  3. An important part of SEO is researching the right keywords for your site. There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider.
