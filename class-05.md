Three Rules for Creating Images
  1. Save Images in the right format -- websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif or png format.
  2. Save images at the right size -- save images at the width & height (in pixels) that you want them to appear at on your webpage.
  3. Measure images in pixels -- always measure images in terms of pixels.
Figure + FigCaption Element -- added to HTML5 allows us to easily group images and their captions in one nice section.

RGB Values -- values for red, green and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. Example: rgb(102, 205, 170) = 102 red, 205 green, 170 blue.
Hex Codes -- represented for red, green and blue in hexadecimal code. Example: #66cdaa = 66:102 red, cd:205 green, aa:170 blue.
HSL colors -- stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness. Hue uses a 0 to 360 number, Saturation uses a 0% to 100% scale, Ligthness also uses a 0% to 100% scale.

Line-through -- use "text-decoration: line-through" to add a line through words.
Blink -- use "text-decoration: blink" to animates test and have it flash on and off and annoy people in the process.

Links Visited and Unvisited -- in CSS there are two psuedoproperties that allow you to set different styles fo links that have and have not yet been visited.
  1. "a:link" allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visisted
  2. "a:visited" allows you to set styles for links that have nt yet been visited.
