I do not currently have any concrete ideas as to what I want to do for a project. I am better at building on ideas than coming up with them. That said the Rijksmuseum is a great museum and the idea of having access to over 400,000 images from their collection and doing something with that could be interesting. The vechicle related apis could also be interesting with regards to building a project around car purchasing/valuing.
