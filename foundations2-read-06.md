Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. 

OR 

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Modern JavaScript Frameworks, such as React and Angular (and many, many related packages), are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.
