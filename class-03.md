Definition Lists
  1. Created with the <dl> element usually with pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements
    1.a. <dt> elements stand for definition term.
    1.b. <dd> elements stand for definition and come after <dt> elements.
Centering Content
    1. If you want to center a box on a page, or a box's content within said box, then you can set left-margin and right-margin to auto.
      1.a. You need to set the width of the box beforehand otherwise it will take the full width of the page.
Switch statements: a possibly faster alternative to if ... else statements
    1. A switch statement starts with a variable call the "switch variable". Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the varibale matches that value.
    2. The entire statement lives in one code block {set of curly braces}. and a colon sperates the option from the statements that are to be run if the case matches the switch value.
    3. At the end of each case is the "break" keyword. It tells the JavaScript interpreter that it has finished with this switch statement and to proceed to run and subsequent code that appears after it.
  4. If none of the code matches then switches statements have default case which would be executed. This default code also has a break keyword.

JavaScript = "weak typing" because the data type for a value can change. Some other languages require that you specify what data type each varibale will be, these languages are said to be "strong type".

For loops
  1. Basic Format: for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
    1.a. var i = 0; is the intializaion and this varibale acts as the counter.
    1.b. i < 10; is the condition and tells us when the counter will stop.
    1.c. i++ is the update that increases the counter each time the loop is run.
