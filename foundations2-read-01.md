template literals = backticks and ${} format of writing strings. Can do multi-line template literals by simply putting them on the next line in the code by within the same back ticks. We used these in our group project and I had been using them on and off since starting Alchemy so this is pretty straightforward.

The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.
  Example Code: array1.forEach(element => console.log(element)); this would log every element in array1
  
For Loop vs forEach: the follwing two lines of example code do the same thing but arguably the forEach is easier to read.
  1. for loop: for (var i = 0; i < students.length; i++) { console.log(students[i]); }
  2. forEach: students.forEach(function(student) { console.log(student); });
