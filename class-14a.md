Notes from New York Times article regarding Google Teams research:
  1. Different Strokes for Different Folks
  2. Be Yourself
  3. Communicate
  4. "In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs."

There are lots of ways to transform or skew elements in CSS in both 2d and 3d. Though I currently lack the imagination or interest to really see when this would be useful rather than something that would annoy the user.

There are also heaps of ways to add various aminations to elements on your webpage and said animations would probably impress people new to programming or children, but I'm cynical about their actual usefulness and whether using them would ever actually make sense in a professional setting/webpage.

Fade In: a simple effect that emphasizes functionality 
  1. Example code: .fade { opacity:0.5; } .fade:hover { opacity:1; }
Color Change: another simple effect that emphasizes functionality
  1. Example code: .color:hover { background:#53a7ea; }
Grow Element: a third simple effect that emphasizes functionality
  1. Example code: .grow:hover { -webkit-transform: scale(1.3); -ms-transform: scale(1.3); transform: scale(1.3); }
