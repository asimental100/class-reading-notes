Atomic Design: Page => Templates => Organisms => Molecules => Atoms
  1. Basic Steps
    1. a. Split the page design into large sections — Organisms
    1. b. Next, divide your Organisms into Molecules, Look out for sections that are repeated frequently
    1. c.Then, Extract your atoms from the Molecules. Remember elements that can’t be broken up any further
  2. Atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module or class[1] should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function.

There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state.
  1. props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).
  
Callback = a function that is to be executed after another function (normally asynchronous) has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.
  1. More complexly stated: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument and subsequently called by the function that receives it, is called a callback function.
  
First Class Function: A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
